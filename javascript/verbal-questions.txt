// Map vs FlatMap

// map vs forEach
------------
  forEach => modifies the origin array
        map => doesn't change the original array and can chain more methods like filter


// null vs undefined
---------
    null => is an actual value
    undefined => variable is defined, but value is not set 
    null == undefined => true
    null === undefined => false
    

// synthetic events
-------------------
    In React, there is a wrapper around default browser event called "Synthetic Event"
    React 16 automatically attaches event listeners to document node
    React 17 automatically attaches event listeners to root node element

    React follow "Event Bubbling" and execute event handler during bubbling phase
